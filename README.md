# Dedalus Scripts

A repository for various Dedalus scripts. Included are:

- SQG.py: an implementation of the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic equation with finite depth capability
- ODE.py: a silly example showing you can use a PDE solver to solve a simple coupled ODE system
- QG_sphere: solves the 2D rotating Euler equations on a sphere, modified from the ivp shallow water example
- Reaction_Diffusion.py: solves the Gray-Scott model for two reacting (and diffusing) substances
- Schrodinger.py: solves the Schrodinger equation for a free particle using complex fields
- Kelvin_Helmholtz.py: solves the 2D Boussinesq equations with a stratified shear layer as the initial condition
- 2D_QG.py: solves the single layer (2D) quasi-geostrophic equation with a random forcing term
- 3D_NS.py: solves the 3D (rotating) Boussinesq equations with a random forcing term
